## Getting started

### Prepare your environment

- x64 / aarch64 machine with at least 2GB of memory and ~35GB of disk space for a VM, container or native OS,
- Ubuntu Jammy 22.04 x64 or aarch64 for native building or any [Docker](https://docs.armbian.com/Developer-Guide_Building-with-Docker/) capable x64 / aarch64 Linux for containerised,
- Superuser rights (configured sudo or root access).

### Simply start with the build script

```bash
apt-get -y install git
git clone https://github.com/chainsx/armbian-d1-build
cd build
./compile.sh
```

- Interactive graphical interface.
- The workspace will be prepared by installing the necessary dependencies and sources.
- It guides the entire process until a kernel package or ready-to-use image of the SD card is created.

### Build parameter examples

Show work in progress areas in interactive mode:

```bash
./compile.sh EXPERT="yes"
```

Run build framework inside Docker container:

```bash
./compile.sh docker
```

Build minimal CLI Armbian Focal image for Orangepi Zero. Use modern kernel and write image to the SD card:

```bash
./compile.sh \
BOARD=orangepizero \
BRANCH=current \
RELEASE=focal \
BUILD_MINIMAL=yes \
BUILD_DESKTOP=no \
KERNEL_ONLY=no \
KERNEL_CONFIGURE=no \
CARD_DEVICE="/dev/sda"
```
